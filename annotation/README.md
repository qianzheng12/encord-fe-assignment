# Annotation home task

This React APP is help user to upload image, predict image and show the result of predictions.

# Start:
npm install

npm run build 

npm start


# Note:
This application doesn't call any API , so it only load initial data from a local json 
file, and use state to cache any update on images or prediction results.

To make it look better, I have hard coded that whenever user upload a new image, it will just use an apple image I saved
in the public. And when a prediction triggered for this apple image, a hard coded prediction result will be loaded.
